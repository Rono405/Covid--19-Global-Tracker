# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project visualizes and explores the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using real-time data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). It presents trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries using Python data analysis and visualization tools.

## Objectives

- Clean and prepare COVID-19 datasets for analysis.
- Analyze global and country-level trends over time.
- Visualize key metrics like total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Provide both static and interactive plots for better insights.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rono405/Covid--19-Global-Tracker.git
   cd covid19-global-data-tracker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Create a virtual environment (optional) and install packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**
   Download `owid-covid-data.csv` from [this link](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and save it to the `data/` folder.

4. **Run the Notebook**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `covid19_analysis.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Insights and Reflections

- Countries show varied trends in infections and vaccination progress.
- Data cleaning is essential due to frequent updates and missing values.
- Visualizations help reveal spikes, recovery trends, and vaccination gaps.
- This project improved my skills in data analysis and storytelling through data.
